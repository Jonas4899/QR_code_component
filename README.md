## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

One of the most useful tricks used in this project was to define the font size as shown bellow: 

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
```

This allows us to define the font size in 10px. With this change, it's easier to use relative units as "rem". For instance, I want to define a 25px height of a div. Then you should write something like:

```css
div {
  height: 2.5rem;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects I want to focus on making better layouts with CSS flexbox and CSS grid. Also, use good practices to code for better understanding.

### Useful resources

- [A complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - In this guide you have all properties that you need when using Flexbox.
